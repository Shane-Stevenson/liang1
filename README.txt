future:

Train counting AI on a greater portion and test on a smaller portion. (adjust AI model)

Adjust autoencoder to be better

train AI on autoencoded and compare to the simply flattened data



Branch into 2 options from here:

1. look into semi-supervised learning

2. look into actual segmentation (Once again labeling is going to be difficult)
